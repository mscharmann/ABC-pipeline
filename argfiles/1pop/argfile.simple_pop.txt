# special flags that are allowed:
## NOte: this is a single pop, three Ne phases, recent phase = exponential trend, intermediate phase = constant size, ancient phase = constant size

## NUMBER OF ITERATIONS
nreps = NREPS


## POPULATION SIZES
# popsize_parameter = desired_popsize / Ne(0) # Ne(0) is a scaling constant that we assume to be 100,000
# recent = most recent phase, has exponential growth from ancient size to this recent size; ancient = the phase before that, is constant
# N_priors_shape must be one of 'flat' or 'lognormal'. It applies to ALL population size priors.
# If lognormal, one has to specify additional arguments 'N_mode_of_lognormal' AND 'N_sigma'.
# Lognormal distributions will be truncated within lower,upper just as the flat distributions.
# N1_interm can indepdentently be set to: a free range OR "N1_recent" OR "larger_than_recent" OR "smaller_than_recent"
# N1_ancient can indepdentently be set to: a free range OR "N1_interm" OR "larger_than_interm" OR "smaller_than_interm"

## TIME PARAMETERS: bear in mind that the direction of time is pastward, i.e. 0=present and >0 is further in the past! 
# thus the meaning of start and stop is reversed from common sense.
# larger values mean deeper back in time, longer ago
# T_parameter = T(generations)/4*Ne(0) # Ne(0) is a scaling constant that we assume to be 100,000
# my definition of generation time: average age of mothers at birth of their daughters -> estimate this at 20 years, (regardless of the shape of the reproduction-age distribution, 
# over many generations only the average should be relevant) -> T(10.000.000 years) = 500.000 -> tau = 1.25; 100 generations = 0.00025 T-units

# the time when population sizes enter from recent phase into the intermediate phase (Obviously truncated by T_N1_ancient), and when entering from intermediate phase into ancient phase.

T_N1_ancient = 0.0,1.0
