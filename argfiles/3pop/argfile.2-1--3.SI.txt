## POPULATION SIZES
# popsize_parameter = desired_popsize / Ne(0) # Ne(0) is a scaling constant that we assume to be 100,000
# recent = most recent phase, has exponential growth from ancient size to this recent size; ancient = the phase before that, is constant
# N_priors_shape must be one of 'flat' or 'lognormal'. It applies to ALL population size priors.
# If lognormal, one has to specify additional arguments 'N_mode_of_lognormal' AND 'N_sigma'.
# Lognormal distributions will be truncated within lower,upper just as the flat distributions.
# all three of Ni_ancient can indepdentently be set to: a free range OR "N[i]_recent" OR "larger_than_recent" OR "smaller_than_recent"

## TIME PARAMETERS: bear in mind that the direction of time is pastward, i.e. 0=present and >0 is further in the past! 
# thus the meaning of start and stop is reversed from common sense.
# larger values mean deeper back in time, longer ago

# over many generations only the average should be relevant) -> T(10.000.000 years) = 500.000 -> tau = 1.25; 100 generations = 0.004 T-units

## MIGRATION RATES: tested the Fst, netdiv vs. migration rate (homogenous): Panmixia-like outcomes (netdiv scattered around 0) are achieved at c. m >= 50; this holds for 
# an extreme range of N and T values . m = 50 => proporion of migrants per generation = 0.000125
# m_parameter_into_x = ( 4*N(0) * Nx ) * m ; m is the fraction of a population which is replaced by migrants in each generation
# here we supply m, the fraction of immigrants per generation ! draw_priors will calculate M
# prior is on log10 scale! range 0,1 is allowed. To set m to zero, specify 0,0. Even though 10^0 = 1, the prior_draw script handles 0 as zero, not as 10^0=1. To set m=1, use a very small negative number, e.g. -0.0000001 .

# heterogenous_binomial: 	two classes of migration rates among loci: migration rate is either zero or m_scale with probability prop_mig; beta-parameters are ignored
