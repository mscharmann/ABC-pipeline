# special flags that are allowed:
# T_m_stop = T_merge_2_into_1 # to fix the stop (in rev time; in fwd time: start) of m12 and m21 to the time of their speciation

## NUMBER OF ITERATIONS
nreps = 1000

## POPULATION SIZES
# popsize_parameter = desired_popsize / Ne(0) # Ne(0) is a scaling constant that we assume to be 100,000; here N ranges from 1,000 to 10^6
N1 = 0.01,2
N2 = 0.01,2
N3 = 0.01,2
Nanc12 = 0.01,2
Nanc123 = 0.01,2

## TIME PARAMETERS: bear in mind that the direction of time is pastward, i.e. 0=present and >0 is further in the past! 
# thus the meaning of start and stop is reversed from common sense.
# larger values mean deeper back in time, longer ago
# T_parameter = T(generations)/4*Ne(0) # Ne(0) is a scaling constant that we assume to be 100,000
# my definition of generation time: average age of mothers at birth of their daughters -> estimate this at 20 years, (regardless of the shape of the reproduction-age distribution, 
# over many generations only the average should be relevant) -> T(10.000.000 years) = 500.000 -> tau = 1.25; 100 generations = 0.00025 T-units
# seeting the max here to 1,6 million generations, which is c. 32 million years if generationtime = 20y
# the geographic splits within species must have been MUCH more recent, say within the last 100.000 generations.

## MIGRATION RATES: tested the Fst, netdiv vs. migration rate (homogenous): Panmixia-like outcomes (netdiv scattered around 0) are achieved at c. m >= 50; this holds for 
# an extreme range of N and T values . m = 50 => proporion of migrants per generation = 0.000125
# m_parameter_into_x = ( 4*N(0) * Nx ) * m ; m is the fraction of a population which is replaced by migrants in each generation
m12_scale = 0,20
m21_scale = 0,20
m23_scale = 0,20
m32_scale = 0,20

## MIGRATION SHAPE: one of 'homogenous', 'heterogenous_beta' or 'heterogenous_binomial'
# homogenous: 				all loci have the same migration rate given by m_scale; beta-parameters and prob_mig parameters are ignored
# heterogenous_beta: 		per-locus migration rate is drawn from beta-distribution with parameters beta1 & beta2, then scaled by m_scale; prob_mig parameters are ignored
# heterogenous_binomial: 	two classes of migration rates among loci: migration rate is either zero or m_scale with probability prop_mig; beta-parameters are ignored
## migration between 1 and 2 is homogenous due to the fixed prior (See below) !!!
migration_shape = heterogenous_binomial

# m_prop_mig parameters: proportion of loci having migration > 0 (i.e. m_scale); must be between 0 and 1
## migration between 1 and 2 is homogenous due to the fixed prior!!!
